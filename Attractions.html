			<h2>Somerset Falls</h2>
			<p>Somerset Falls is located just a short ride away from its capital city of Port Antonio. <br>
				A few cascades meander through the scenic green backdrop of woodland and rocks;<br>
				the preserved natural elements of the venue create somewhat twisted and angled steps for visitors to maneuver.<br>
				For an extra dose of wonder, patrons wait by that waterfall on a solid platform to board a small boat.<br>
				The ride will have passengers brushing shoulders with olive-green plants wet from the freshwater’s constant flow.<br> 
				The boat will travel beyond the main waterfall and into a shadowy, narrow gorge. Just when you thought the river <br>
				pouring down the mountainside was gorgeous enough, a 32-foot teardrop cascade (appropriately nicknamed Hidden Falls) is revealed!<br>
				If you’re staying in Kingston or Ocho Rios,it will take approximately 1 and a half hours to arrive.<br>
				From Montego Bay, it will take about 3 and a half hours.<br>
				It's aproximately 5 hours from Negril.</p>
